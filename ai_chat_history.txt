Help me understand this assignment, I want to do the Customer Support Ticket Analyzer

Edit
I'll help you understand this Customer Support Ticket Analyzer assignment. Let me break down what you need to build:

Core Concept
You're building a multi-agent system using Pydantic AI where different AI agents work together to analyze customer support tickets and determine how they should be routed/handled.

What You're Analyzing
Each ticket contains:

ticket_id: Unique identifier
customer_tier: free/premium/enterprise (indicates customer value)
subject & message: The actual issue description
previous_tickets: How many tickets this customer has submitted before
monthly_revenue: How much money this customer brings in
account_age_days: How long they've been a customer
Multi-Agent Architecture (Key Requirement)
You need at least 2 specialized agents with distinct roles. Here are some possibilities:

Agent Ideas:

Priority Classifier Agent - Determines urgency (low/medium/high/critical)
Category Agent - Classifies issue type (technical, billing, feature request, security)
Customer Value Assessor - Evaluates customer importance based on tier/revenue/history
Routing Agent - Decides which support team should handle it
Sentiment Analyzer - Assesses customer emotional state
The Challenge: Agent Coordination
The key insight is that agents should complement each other, not just divide work. For example:

What if the Priority Agent says "low priority" but the Customer Value Agent says "high-value customer"?
How do you resolve conflicts between agent recommendations?
How do agents share information and build on each other's analysis?
Test Cases Analysis
Looking at the 5 provided tickets:

SUP-001: Angry new free user - high emotion, low value
SUP-002: Calm enterprise customer with minor issue - high value, low urgency
SUP-003: Premium customer with feature request - medium value, not urgent
SUP-004: Premium customer with API confusion - technical issue, needs clarification
SUP-005: Enterprise customer with security concern - high value, high urgency
What You Need to Deliver
Code: Working Pydantic AI implementation
AI Chat History: Your full development conversation (this shows your problem-solving process)
Write-up: What didn't work and lessons learned
Video (optional but recommended): 3-5 minute explanation
Evaluation Framework
You need to test your system on all 5 tickets and measure at least 3 metrics, such as:

Consistency of routing decisions
Accuracy of priority classification
Customer satisfaction prediction
Response time recommendations
Would you like me to help you design the specific agent architecture or start working on the implementation? What aspects would you like to explore first?




Give me step by step in-depth instructions with code in the form of a tutorial to complete this assignment end to end

Edit
I'll create a comprehensive tutorial to build the Customer Support Ticket Analyzer system from scratch. This will be a complete end-to-end guide.

UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xff in position 0: invalid start byte

Edit
The error is caused by an encoding issue with your .env file. This typically happens when the file was created with the wrong encoding or has a Byte Order Mark (BOM). Let's fix this step by step:

Solution 1: Recreate the .env file
Delete the existing .env file in your project directory
Create a new .env file using a plain text editor:
Option A: Using Command Prompt

cmd
cd C:\Users\arnav\OneDrive\Desktop\customer-support-analyzer
echo OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here > .env
Option B: Using PowerShell

powershell
cd C:\Users\arnav\OneDrive\Desktop\customer-support-analyzer
"OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here" | Out-File -FilePath .env -Encoding utf8
Option C: Using Notepad

Open Notepad
Type: OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
Save as .env (make sure to select "All Files" in the file type dropdown)
Set encoding to "UTF-8" when saving
Solution 2: Fix the encoding issue in the code
If you want to make the code more robust, update the agent files to handle encoding issues:


Fixed Priority Agent with Better Error Handling
Code 
Solution 3: Alternative environment setup
If you're still having issues, you can set the environment variable directly in Windows:

Option A: Set in PowerShell session

powershell
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key_here"
python main.py
Option B: Set system environment variable

Press Win + R, type sysdm.cpl, press Enter
Click "Environment Variables"
Under "User variables", click "New"
Variable name: OPENAI_API_KEY
Variable value: your_actual_api_key_here
Click OK, restart your terminal
Solution 4: Quick test without .env file
Create a simple test file to verify everything else works:


Test Setup Script
Code 
Step-by-step fix:
First, fix the .env file:
cmd
cd C:\Users\arnav\OneDrive\Desktop\customer-support-analyzer
del .env
echo OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key_here > .env
Make sure you have your actual OpenAI API key (starts with sk-)
Test the setup:
cmd
python test_setup.py
If that works, try the main script:
cmd
python main.py
Common causes of this error:
BOM (Byte Order Mark): File was saved with UTF-8 BOM instead of UTF-8
Wrong encoding: File was saved with Windows encoding instead of UTF-8
Binary data: File contains non-text characters
Try the command-line approach first (Solution 1, Option A) as it's the most reliable. Let me know if you're still getting errors after recreating the .env file!

encountering a UserError from the pydantic_ai library, stating "Unknown model: google-gla:gemini-1.5-flash".

Edit
This error indicates that pydantic-ai doesn't recognize the model name google-gla:gemini-1.5-flash. The issue is likely with the model identifier format or prefix.

For Google's Gemini models in pydantic-ai, try these corrections:

Use the correct prefix: Instead of google-gla:, try:
gemini-1.5-flash (without any prefix)
google:gemini-1.5-flash
gemini:gemini-1.5-flash
Check available models: You can list supported models in pydantic-ai:
python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
# This will show you the exact model names supported
Verify your setup: Make sure you have:
The correct API key configured
The right environment variables set (usually GOOGLE_API_KEY or GEMINI_API_KEY)
The latest version of pydantic-ai installed
Try alternative model names:
python
# Common working formats:
model = "gemini-1.5-flash"
# or
model = "google:gemini-1.5-flash"
The exact model identifier format can vary between versions of pydantic-ai, so checking the current documentation or using a simple model name like "gemini-1.5-flash" is often the safest approach.

What does your current model initialization code look like? I can help you adjust the specific syntax.




exceeded the request quota for the Google Gemini API (free tier), what should i do?

Edit
Here are your options when you've hit the Gemini API free tier quota:

Immediate Solutions
Wait for quota reset: Free tier quotas typically reset daily (usually at midnight UTC). Check Google AI Studio or your API dashboard for the exact reset time.
Switch to a different model temporarily:
Try OpenAI's API (has its own free tier)
Use Anthropic's Claude API
Try other free alternatives like Hugging Face Transformers
Upgrade Options
Upgrade to paid tier: Google's paid Gemini API tiers offer:
Higher rate limits
More requests per minute/day
Better reliability for production use
Use Google AI Studio: If you're just experimenting, Google AI Studio provides a web interface with generous free usage that's separate from the API quota.
Alternative Approaches
Optimize your usage:
Batch multiple questions into single requests
Cache responses to avoid repeat calls
Use shorter prompts when possible
Try local models: For development/testing:
Ollama with local Llama models
GPT4All
Hugging Face transformers running locally
Quick Fix for Development
If you're just testing pydantic-ai, you could temporarily switch to OpenAI:

python
# Instead of gemini
model = "openai:gpt-3.5-turbo"  # or gpt-4
# Make sure you have OPENAI_API_KEY set
What's your use case? Are you developing something or just experimenting? I can suggest the best path forward based on your needs.




stick to gemini, p.s. after a minute sup-004 passes. try implementing rate-limiting

Edit
Good approach! Rate limiting will help you stay within Gemini's free tier quotas. Here's how to implement it with pydantic-ai:


Rate-Limited Gemini with pydantic-ai
Code 
This rate limiter implementation provides:

Key Features
Dual Limits: Tracks both per-minute and per-day limits
Automatic Waiting: Sleeps until quota is available
Status Monitoring: Shows current usage and remaining capacity
Both Sync/Async: Works with both synchronous and asynchronous calls
Usage Tips
Conservative Limits: Start with lower limits (10/min, 1000/day) to stay well under quota
Monitor Status: Use agent.get_status() to track usage
Handle Errors: Still catches quota errors in case limits are hit
Gemini Free Tier Limits
Based on typical free tier limits, try these settings:

Per minute: 10-15 requests
Per day: 1000-1500 requests
Quick Start
python
# Simple usage
agent = RateLimitedAgent(calls_per_minute=10, calls_per_day=1000)

# Single request
result = agent.run("Your prompt here")

# Multiple requests (automatically rate limited)
for prompt in your_prompts:
    result = agent.run(prompt)  # Will wait if needed
The rate limiter will automatically pause between requests when you approach the limits, helping you avoid quota errors while maximizing your free tier usage.

Perfect! I've added semaphore support to the rate limiter. Here's what the semaphore adds:

Key Semaphore Benefits
Concurrency Control: Limits how many requests can run simultaneously (default: 3)
Resource Protection: Prevents overwhelming the API with too many concurrent calls
Memory Management: Avoids creating too many pending requests
How the Semaphore Works
asyncio.Semaphore(max_concurrent): Controls concurrent request limit
async with self.semaphore: Each request acquires a semaphore slot
Thread-safe: Uses asyncio.Lock() to protect rate limiter state
Smart Waiting: Releases the lock during sleep to allow other tasks
Enhanced Status Monitoring
The get_status() method now shows:

Rate limiting info (calls per minute/day)
Available semaphore slots
Maximum concurrent requests allowed
Usage Examples
Basic concurrent batch:

python
agent = RateLimitedAgent(max_concurrent=3)

# These 10 requests will run in batches of 3
tasks = [agent.run_async(f"Question {i}") for i in range(10)]
results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
Monitor concurrent usage:

python
status = agent.get_status()
print(f"Available slots: {status['semaphore_available']}")
print(f"Max concurrent: {status['max_concurrent']}")
Recommended Settings for Gemini Free Tier
python
agent = RateLimitedAgent(
    calls_per_minute=8,   # Conservative
    calls_per_day=800,    # Well under limit  
    max_concurrent=2      # Gentle on API
)
The semaphore ensures you won't accidentally spam the API with too many concurrent requests, which is especially important with free tier quotas!




does this retry with a delay when quota is hit?

Edit
Looking at the current code, it does partial retry but not complete retry. Here's what it currently does:

Current Behavior
Proactive waiting: Waits before making requests when rate limits predict quota issues
Error detection: Catches quota errors and prints helpful messages
No automatic retry: If a quota error actually occurs, it raises the exception instead of retrying
What's Missing
The code doesn't retry after hitting an actual quota error from the API. Let me add exponential backoff retry logic:


Rate-Limited Gemini with pydantic-ai
Code ∙ Version 9 

Rate-Limited Gemini with pydantic-ai
Code ∙ Version 10 

Rate-Limited Gemini with pydantic-ai
Code ∙ Version 11 

Rate-Limited Gemini with pydantic-ai
Code ∙ Version 12 
Perfect! Now the code does retry with exponential backoff when quota errors occur. Here's what's been added:

New Retry Features
Exponential Backoff: Delays increase exponentially (1min, 2min, 4min, 8min...)
Smart Error Detection: Recognizes various quota error patterns:
"quota exceeded"
"rate limit"
"too many requests"
HTTP 429 errors
"resource_exhausted"
Configurable Retries: You can set max_retries per request
Retry Logic Flow
Request → Quota Error → Wait 1 min → Retry
         → Quota Error → Wait 2 min → Retry  
         → Quota Error → Wait 4 min → Retry
         → Success/Final Failure
Usage Examples
Basic retry:

python
# Will retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
result = await agent.run_async("Your prompt", max_retries=3)
Batch with individual retry control:

python
tasks = [
    agent.run_async(f"Question {i}", max_retries=2) 
    for i in range(10)
]
results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
Complete Protection Strategy
Now you have three layers of protection:

Proactive Rate Limiting: Prevents hitting quotas in the first place
Semaphore: Limits concurrent requests to avoid overwhelming the API
Retry with Backoff: Handles actual quota errors gracefully
This gives you maximum resilience for working with Gemini's free tier quotas!




what did you cap concurrency to?

Edit
Looking at the code, I set the default concurrency to 3:

python
def __init__(self, model: str = "gemini-1.5-flash", 
             calls_per_minute: int = 15, calls_per_day: int = 1500,
             max_concurrent: int = 3):  # <-- Default is 3
And in the example usage, I also used 3:

python
agent = RateLimitedAgent(
    model="gemini-1.5-flash",
    calls_per_minute=10,
    calls_per_day=1000,
    max_concurrent=3      # Max 3 concurrent requests
)
But later in the recommendations, I suggested being even more conservative with 2 for the free tier:

python
agent = RateLimitedAgent(
    calls_per_minute=8,
    calls_per_day=800,
    max_concurrent=2      # Gentle on API
)
You can adjust this based on your needs:

max_concurrent=1: Most conservative, sequential requests only
max_concurrent=2-3: Good balance for free tier
max_concurrent=5+: For paid tiers with higher limits
The semaphore is configurable, so you can set it to whatever works best for your quota limits!
