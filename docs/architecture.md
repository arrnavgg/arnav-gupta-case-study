# Multi-Agent Customer Support System Architecture

## System Overview

Our multi-agent system uses specialized AI agents that work together to analyze customer support tickets and make routing decisions. This approach provides several advantages over a single-agent system:

1. **Specialization**: Each agent focuses on one aspect of analysis
2. **Parallel Processing**: Agents can work simultaneously for faster analysis
3. **Conflict Resolution**: The coordinator can resolve disagreements between agents
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new agents for additional analysis dimensions

## Agent Architecture

### 1. Priority Agent
- **Role**: Determines urgency level (critical/high/medium/low)
- **Inputs**: Ticket content, customer data, business impact
- **Output**: Priority level with confidence score and reasoning

### 2. Category Agent  
- **Role**: Classifies issue type and subcategory
- **Inputs**: Subject, message content, technical indicators
- **Output**: Category classification with subcategory for routing

### 3. Customer Value Agent
- **Role**: Assesses customer importance and churn risk
- **Inputs**: Customer tier, revenue, account history
- **Output**: Value tier, risk assessment, retention priority

### 4. Sentiment Agent
- **Role**: Analyzes emotional tone and satisfaction risk
- **Inputs**: Message content, communication style
- **Output**: Sentiment classification with urgency indicators

### 5. Routing Coordinator
- **Role**: Makes final routing decisions based on all agent inputs
- **Inputs**: All agent analyses plus original ticket
- **Output**: Final routing decision with resolution time estimate

## Inter-Agent Communication

Agents communicate through structured data models:
- Each agent produces a typed response (Pydantic models)
- The coordinator receives all agent outputs
- Conflicts are resolved using business rules and priorities

## Decision Flow

1. **Parallel Analysis**: Priority, Category, Value, and Sentiment agents analyze simultaneously
2. **Data Aggregation**: Coordinator collects all agent outputs
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Coordinator applies business rules to resolve disagreements
4. **Final Decision**: Routing decision made with comprehensive reasoning

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Multiple Agents?
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent has a clear, focused responsibility
- **Expert Knowledge**: Agents can be fine-tuned for their specific domain
- **Transparency**: Easy to understand why decisions were made
- **Maintainability**: Changes to one analysis type don't affect others

### Conflict Resolution Strategy
When agents disagree, the coordinator uses these rules:
1. **Security Override**: Security issues always get high priority
2. **Customer Value Boost**: High-value customers get priority upgrades
3. **Sentiment Escalation**: Negative sentiment increases priority
4. **Business Impact**: Revenue-affecting issues get expedited handling

### Performance Optimizations
- **Parallel Processing**: Agents run simultaneously using asyncio
- **Structured Outputs**: Pydantic models ensure consistent data format
- **Confidence Tracking**: Low confidence triggers additional review
