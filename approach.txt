# My Approach to Multi-Agent Customer Support Ticket Analyzer

## The Problem I Solved

Customer support teams get overwhelmed with tickets and often struggle to prioritize them correctly. A single AI system trying to handle priority, categorization, customer value assessment, and routing all at once tends to make mistakes or miss important nuances. I needed a smarter way to analyze support tickets that could handle the complexity while being transparent about its decisions.

## Why I Chose Multiple Agents

Instead of building one big AI that tries to do everything, I broke the problem into specialized pieces. Each agent focuses on a specific aspect of ticket analysis:

- **Priority Agent**: Determines how urgent something is based on business impact
- **Category Agent**: Identifies what type of problem this is and where it should go
- **Customer Value Agent**: Assesses which customers are most important to the business
- **Sentiment Agent**: Analyzes the emotional tone and frustration level in the message
- **Routing Coordinator**: Takes all the input and makes the final routing decision

## How It Actually Works

1. **Parallel Analysis**: When a ticket comes in, all four specialist agents look at it simultaneously. This is faster than having them work one after another.

2. **Each Agent Does Their Thing**: 
   - Priority agent asks: "Is this breaking their business?"
   - Category agent asks: "What kind of problem is this?"
   - Value agent asks: "How important is this customer to us?"
   - Sentiment agent asks: "How upset/frustrated are they?"

3. **The Coordinator Decides**: The coordinator takes all their recommendations and applies business rules. For example, if it's a security issue, it goes to the security team regardless of what other agents think.

## Why This Approach Works Better

**Specialization**: Each agent can focus on getting really good at one thing instead of being mediocre at everything.

**Transparency**: When the system makes a decision, I can see exactly why. If the priority seems wrong, I can look at just the priority agent's reasoning.

**Conflict Resolution**: Sometimes agents disagree - maybe something seems low priority but the customer is really upset. The coordinator has rules for handling these conflicts.

**Easy to Improve**: If I want better sentiment analysis, I only need to work on that one agent without breaking everything else.

## Real Example

Here's how it handled an angry free-tier customer:
- **Priority Agent**: "Low priority - free customer, login issue"
- **Sentiment Agent**: "High negative sentiment - very frustrated"
- **Value Agent**: "Low value but new customer - retention opportunity"
- **Coordinator**: "Upgrade to medium priority due to sentiment and retention risk"

The single-agent approach might have just seen "free customer with login issue" and marked it low priority. But the multi-agent system caught the emotional context and business opportunity.

## The Technical Implementation

I used PydanticAI with Google's Gemini model, with each agent having its own specialized prompt and structured output format. The system handles rate limiting and runs agents in parallel for speed. I also built in evaluation metrics to measure how well the agents work together.

The whole thing is designed to be practical - it gives clear routing decisions with time estimates and explains its reasoning in plain English so support teams can trust and understand the decisions.
